Commit 10.06.22

Stable version of CLI and API using default redis client.


Tests:
- discarding tests since funcs
are simplified, testing them
would be trivial and current release
satisfies app requirements

CLI:
- change to simplified file structure:
    - commands.go
    - create_app.go
    - flags.go
    - initialize.go
    - start.go

Redis:
- change to simplified file structure:
    - settings.go
    - start.go
    - tools.go
    - url.go
    - users.go
    - api.go
    
API:
- server.go to run server
- implementation of simple views:
    - notFound for 404
    - viewURL for "/!url" path
    - redirectURL for "/url" path
